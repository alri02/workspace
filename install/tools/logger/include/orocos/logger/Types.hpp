#warning including logger/Types.hpp directly is deprecated \
         You should include the headers that define your types directly. \
         typekit/Opaques.hpp should include logger/typekit/OpaqueFwd.hpp and \
         typekit/Opaques.cpp should include logger/typekit/OpaqueTypes.hpp. \
         (in doubt, see the files in templates/typekit for both of these) \
         Finally, if you are reall really sure, you can still include \
         logger/typekit/Types.hpp \
         Be warned that this last option may disappear at any moment
#include <logger/typekit/Types.hpp>
