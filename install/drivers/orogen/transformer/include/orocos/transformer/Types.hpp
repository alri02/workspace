#warning including transformer/Types.hpp directly is deprecated \
         You should include the headers that define your types directly. \
         typekit/Opaques.hpp should include transformer/typekit/OpaqueFwd.hpp and \
         typekit/Opaques.cpp should include transformer/typekit/OpaqueTypes.hpp. \
         (in doubt, see the files in templates/typekit for both of these) \
         Finally, if you are reall really sure, you can still include \
         transformer/typekit/Types.hpp \
         Be warned that this last option may disappear at any moment
#include <transformer/typekit/Types.hpp>
