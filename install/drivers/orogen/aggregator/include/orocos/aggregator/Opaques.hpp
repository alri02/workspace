#warning including aggregator/Opaques.hpp is deprecated \
         If in typekit/Opaques.cpp, you should include aggregator/typekit/OpaqueTypes.hpp and aggregator/typekit/Opaques.hpp. \
         In doubt, see templates/typekit/Opaques.cpp.
#include <aggregator/typekit/Opaques.hpp>
#include <aggregator/typekit/OpaqueTypes.hpp>
